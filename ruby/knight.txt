each position has 8 potential moves

when you move to a different spot, calculate the next 8 possible moves (maybe 7 if we subtract where it came from)
	exclude values that may go off the board
	stop if we the destination is reached

create a bst for each possible move
	add nodes based on potential moves from there
	place array into the value for the node, create more nodes based on +1+2, +2+1,-1+2, etc. until value == destination

input will be an array coordinate(e.g., [0, 0]) as root

node has current_spot
	next_move

knight starts at [0,0]
if possible moves.all? value.positive? is true, then run function
